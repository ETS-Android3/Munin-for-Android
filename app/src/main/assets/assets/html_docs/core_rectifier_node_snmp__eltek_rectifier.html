<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>snmp__eltek_rectifier - Munin multigraph plugin for ELTEK rectifier/UPSes</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>The device must support the ELTEK-DISTRIBUTED-MIB. This includes ELTEK Minipack and other rectifiers and UPSes from ELTEK.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>As a rule SNMP plugins need site specific configuration. The default configuration (shown here) will only work on insecure sites/devices.</p> 
<pre>   [snmp_*]
        env.version 2
        env.community public</pre> 
<p>In general SNMP is not very secure at all unless you use SNMP version 3 which supports authentication and privacy (encryption). But in any case the community string for your devices should not be &quot;public&quot;.</p> 
<p>Please see 'perldoc Munin::Plugin::SNMP' for further configuration information.</p> 
<h1>INTERPRETATION</h1> 
<p>Please refer to the ELTEK-DISTRIBUTED-MIB when in doubt.</p> 
<h1>MIB INFORMATION</h1> 
<p>This plugin requires support for the ELTEK-DISTRIBUTED-MIB published by ELTEK.</p> 
<h1>PROGRAMMERS</h1> 
<p>This plugin is actually a generic SNMP multigraph plugin. If you customize the data structures, especially %oidList and %label which is used to drive the loops. Take care that labels and structure of these hashes match otherwise things will disappear with not much warning. But se munin-node.log, munin-update.log and run the plugin with unin-run.</p>

<h1>BUGS</h1> 
<p>The plugin was written for rectifiers, but will probably also be activated for ELTEK UPSes which it is not particularly suited for.</p>
