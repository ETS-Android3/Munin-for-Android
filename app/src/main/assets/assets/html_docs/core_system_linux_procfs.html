<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>procfs - Plugin to monitor general system statistics</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>All Linux systems where /proc is accessible.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>The following is default configuration</p> 
<pre>  [cpu]
        env.HZ  100</pre> 
<dl> 
 <dt>
  <code>env.HZ</code>
 </dt> 
 <dd> 
  <p>Some combinations of hardware and Linux (probably only 2.4 kernels) use 1000 units/second in /proc/stat corresponding to the systems HZ. (see /usr/src/linux/include/asm/param.h). But Almost all systems use 100 units/second and this is our default. Even if Documentation/proc.txt in the kernel source says otherwise. - Finding and fix by dz@426.ch</p> 
 </dd> 
</dl> 
<h2>EXAMPLE WARNING AND CRITICAL SETTINGS</h2> 
<p>You can also set warning and critical levels for each of the data series the plugin reports. The following environment variables are used as default for all fields:</p> 
<pre>  env.warning
  env.critical</pre> 
<p>But each field can be controlled separately. The available fields for the CPU graph are:</p> 
<pre>  system, user, nice, idle, iowait, irq, softirq, steal, guest,
  guest_nice</pre> 
<h1>INTERPRETATION</h1> 
<h2>CPU</h2> 
<p>The plugin shows cpu usage in percent. In case of more than one core it displays 100% for each core.</p> 
<p>If a core is 100% busy there will be no &quot;iowait&quot; showing, that only shows if the CPU has nothing else to do while it waits on IO. Therefore a 100% busy core can hide a lot of iowait. Please refer to the IO latency and other disk related graphs for further information about IO performance.</p> 
<h2>INTERRUPTS</h2> 
<p>The plugin monitors the number of interrupts and context switches on a system.</p> 
<h2>FORKS</h2> 
<p>The plugin monitors the number of forks per second on the machine</p> 
<h1>LOAD</h1> 
<p>The plugin monitors the load average of the system (at 1, 5 and 15 minutes). The following fiends can be configured for warning and critical: <code>load1</code>, <code>load</code> and <code>load15</code>, configuring the limit respectively for 1, 5 and 15 minutes average load.</p> 
<h1>UPTIME</h1> 
<p>The plugin measures the uptime of the system in days.</p>
