<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>fw_conntrack - Plugin to monitor the number of tracked connections through a Linux 2.4/2.6 firewall</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>This plugin must run with root privileges</p> 
<h2>CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE</h2> 
<p>/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/global or other file in that dir must contain:</p> 
<pre> [fw_*]
  user root</pre> 
<h1>NOTES</h1> 
<p>ESTABLISHED+FIN_WAIT+TIME_WAIT+SYN_SENT+UDP are the most interesting connections.</p> 
<p>The total list also includes SYN_RECV, CLOSE, CLOSE_WAIT, LAST_ACK and LISTEN, but these were not (often) observed on my firewall.</p> 
<p>TOTAL is the total number of tracked connections.</p> 
<p>ASSURED and UNREPLIED connections are complementary subsets of ESTABLISHED.</p> 
<p>ASSURED is after ACK is seen after SYN_RECV. Therefore ASSURED is plotted but not UNREPLIED.</p> 
<p>Note that the plugin depends on the netfilter &quot;conntrack&quot; userspace tool. It comes from http://conntrack-tools.netfilter.org/</p>
