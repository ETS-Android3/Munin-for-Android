<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>exim_mailstats - Plugin to monitor the number of mails received and delivered by exim.</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>Exim version 3 or 4.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>Usually no configuration is needed for this plugin.</p> 
<pre>  [exim*]
     env.logdir   /path/to/exim-logs/
     env.logname  mainlog
     env.exim     /usr/sbin/exim</pre> 
<p>The default value for the <code>logdir</code> variable is determined by running <code>exim -bP log_file_path</code>. <code>mainlog</code> is the default name given to exims main log, but it has been known to be called &quot;main.log&quot; in some versions of Red Hat/Fedora for example.</p> 
<p>NOTE: If you need to set logname you must also set logdir as there is no automatic way to determine the path then.</p> 
<p>The default value of the <code>exim</code> variable is <code>/usr/sbin/exim</code>, but if there is a executable called <code>/usr/sbin/exim4</code> this is used instead.</p> 
<h1>INTERPRETATION</h1> 
<p>Need some input from an exim postmaster here.</p>

<p>Torstein Svendsen recalls originally writing this with Henrik Grindal Bakken to create MRTG graphs of exims mailqueues for Linpros client RunBox. Thus this code predates Munin itself.</p> 
<p>The first traces of the plugin in CVS seems to be in 2002. Further messing by Jimmy Olsen the same year. Bugfixing and cleanup by Nicolai Langfeldt 2008.</p>
