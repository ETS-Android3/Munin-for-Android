<h1>NAME</h1>
<h2>munin_update</h2>
<p> </p> 
<p>munin_update - Munin plugin to graph the time to query about each host from the nodes.</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>Munin master servers.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>Normaly needs no configuration. You may configure it with the following parameter:</p> 
<pre>  [munin*]
      env.UPDATE_STATSFILE .../munin-update.stats
      env.MUNIN_UPDATE_LOCACTION .../munin-update</pre> 
<p>The first is the statistics file for munin update.</p> 
<p>The exact location of this file is package/site specific, but munin_update will know where it is unless you have made changes.</p> 
<h1>INTERPRETATION</h1> 
<p>The script reads the munin-update &quot;stats&quot; file to determine how long it takes to query the nodes about each host configured in Munin.</p> 
<p>Munin is run from cron every 5 minutes and before the next run of munin-update the previous run needs to be done. Each run of munin-update forks one process pr. host that needs to get data collected, so all collection runs in parallel.</p> 
<p>Any host that is slow, for example slower than 4 miniutes, causes a risk that the next run of munin-update must be cancled due to the lateness of the previous run. In such cases there will be single line gaps in the &quot;by day&quot; graph.</p> 
<p>Keep your hosts updating quickly and all will be well.</p> 
<h1>MAGIC MARKERS</h1> 
<pre>  #%# family=manual
  #%# capabilities=autoconf</pre> 
<h1>BUGS</h1> 
<p>Munin-update is always run at the same time as this plugin runs - therefore the stats file may be incompletely written and the plugin will likely show a incomplete list of hosts. It should be using munin-update.old-stats, which is not currently even made.</p> 
<p>Munin-update removes the &quot;domain&quot; information on all hosts. If there are two hosts with the same host name in different domains then one of them will be disappeared by the munin-update collection process.</p> 
<h1>AUTHOR</h1>
