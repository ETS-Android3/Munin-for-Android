<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>iostat_ios - Show IO-operation latency pr. device.</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>Any Linux system</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>None needed</p> 
<h1>USAGE</h1> 
<p>Link this into /etc/munin/plugins/ and restart the munin-node.</p> 
<h1>INTERPRETATION</h1> 
<p>The plugin shows the average time a IO-operation needs to complete for each disk or block device on the system.</p> 
<p>Simple partitioned disks will only show as the whole disk. When/if you use some device layer over that, such as LVM then LV devices will show up individually.</p> 
<p>When the IO-operation time here increases it is to be expected that the iowait on the CPU graph increases, but please read about how iowait reporting works to fully understand that number.</p> 
<h1>MAGIC MARKERS</h1> 
<pre>  #%# family=legacy
  #%# capabilities=autoconf</pre> 
<h1>VERSION</h1> 
<h1>BUGS</h1> 
<p>Should show more useful device names/labels for device-mapper devices, such as those used by LVM and so on.</p>
