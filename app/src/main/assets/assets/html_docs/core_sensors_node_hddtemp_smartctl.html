<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>hddtemp_smartctl - Plugin to monitor harddrive temperatures through SMART</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>This plugin needs to run as root or some other user that has access to the harddrive devices.</p> 
<p>The following environment variables are used</p> 
<pre> smartctl  - path to smartctl executable
 drives    - List drives to monitor. E.g. &quot;env.drives hda hdc&quot;.
 type_$dev - device type for one drive, e.g. &quot;env.type_sda 3ware,0&quot;
             or more typically &quot;env.type_sda ata&quot; if sda is a SATA disk.
 args_$dev - additional arguments to smartctl for one drive,
             e.g. &quot;env.args_hda -v 194,10xCelsius&quot;.  Use this to make
             the plugin use the --all or -a option if your disk will
             not return its temperature when only the -A option is
             used.
 dev_$dev  - monitoring device for one drive, e.g. twe0</pre> 
<p>If the &quot;smartctl&quot; environment variable is not set the plugin will search your $PATH, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin for a file called &quot;smartctl&quot;, and use that.</p> 
<p>If the &quot;drives&quot; environment variable is not set, the plugin will attempt to search for drives to probe.</p>

<h1>NOTES</h1> 
<p>Note for users of RAID controllers (smartmontools currently only supports 3ware): you can specify the drives attached to your RAID controller(s) as raiddev_num (e.g. sda_0). Then you must specify the type like this: type_sda_0 3ware,0.</p> 
<p>Recent versions of the kernel driver use a separate major device number for monitoring purposes, like /dev/twe&lt;n&gt; or /dev/twa&lt;n&gt;. This can be put in the e.g. dev_sda environment variable, to allow the user to keep sda as the name of the disk.</p> 
<p>To avoid spinning up sleeping disks smartctl will use the --nocheck parameter. If this parameter isn't supported by your version of smartctl then hdparm will be used. Note that hdparm isn't available on all platforms.</p>
