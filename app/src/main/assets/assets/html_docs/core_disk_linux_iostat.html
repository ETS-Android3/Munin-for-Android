<p>iostat - Munin plugin to monitor io-bound traffic (in blocks) on disks</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>Linux systems.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>The plugin detects block devices from /proc/diskstat or /proc/stat. By default it will only show un-numbered devices such as sda and not sda0. By setting</p> 
<pre>   [iostat]
   env.SHOW_NUMBERED 1
   env.include_only sda,sdb</pre> 
<p>it will show numbered devices. This is sometimes needed in virtualized environments (e.g. Xen) where sda1 to sda&lt;n&gt; exists but not sda. In a virtualized environment this is useful to show which guest OS/dom-U IO-traffic originates in.</p>
