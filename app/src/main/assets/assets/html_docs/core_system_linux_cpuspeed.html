<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>cpuspeed - Plugin to monitor CPU speed</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>Linux systems with a working CPU speed governor/stats kernel module that can be accessed through the /sys filesystem.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>None needed by default.</p> 
<p>You can set one environment variable to modify the plugins behaviour:</p> 
<pre>  [cpuspeed]
     env.scaleto100 1</pre> 
<p>Show the frequency as a percentage instead of absolute frequency. If set the plugin sets up a CDEF to change the speed in Hz to percent.</p> 
<p>If you set or unset this the whole time series will be shown in the same way, either as Hz or percent (as the graphs are updated).</p> 
<h1>INTERPRETATION</h1> 
<p>The plugin shows the average CPU speed in the measurement period as represented by /sys/devices/system/cpu/*/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state.</p> 
<p>This is a counter plugin and represents the average. Many cpuspeed plugins reports the &quot;instant&quot; CPU speed at the time the plugin runs. This is not representative for this metric.</p>
