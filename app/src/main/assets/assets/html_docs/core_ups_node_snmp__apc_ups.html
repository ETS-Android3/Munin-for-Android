<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>snmp__apc_ups - Munin multigraph plugin for APC UPSes</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>The UPS must support the PowerNet-MIB published by APC. This includes the APC Smart-UPS series on which this plugin was tested.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>As a rule SNMP plugins need site specific configuration. The default configuration (shown here) will only work on insecure sites/devices.</p> 
<pre>   [snmp_*]
        env.version 2
        env.community public</pre> 
<p>In general SNMP is not very secure at all unless you use SNMP version 3 which supports authentication and privacy (encryption). But in any case the community string for your devices should not be &quot;public&quot;.</p> 
<p>Please see 'perldoc Munin::Plugin::SNMP' for further configuration information.</p> 
<h1>INTERPRETATION</h1> 
<p>Please refer to the PowerNet-MIB when in doubt.</p> 
<h1>MIB INFORMATION</h1> 
<p>This plugin requires support for the PowerNet-MIB published by APC.</p> 
<h1>PROGRAMMERS</h1> 
<p>This plugin is actually a generic SNMP multigraph plugin. If you customize the data structures, especially %oidList and %label which is used to drive the loops. Take care that labels and structure of these hashes match otherwise things will disappear with not much warning. But se munin-node.log, munin-update.log and run the plugin with munin-run.</p>
