<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>iostat.vp_only - Plugin for watching io-bound traffic (in KiloBytes) on disks</p> 
<h1>NOTES</h1> 
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> 
<p>Similar to the iostat script, but will only report usage on vpaths.</p> 
<h2>RESTRICTIONS</h2> 
<p>Same as the iostat script, see its RESTRICTIONS.</p> 
<p>This gathers information on virtual paths ONLY, typical if you have fiber cards installed and are attached to an ESS (Shark) or large disk array.</p> 
<p>This will combine the I/O for all hdisks associated with a vpath so you get global statistics for a vpath. This is to avoid having a list of hdisks that spans multiple pages.</p>
