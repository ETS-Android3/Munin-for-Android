## Contribute
If you don't know where to start, there may be some [open issues](https://github.com/chteuchteu/Munin-for-Android/issues).
Don't hesitate to open new ones if you found a bug!

Also, if the app isn't available or fully translated in your native language, you can
either edit the localization files in the project by cloning it or [use this easy to use
online tool](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/munin-for-android/strings/)!
Translation status: ![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/munin-for-android/-/shields-badge.svg)

When cloning the project and running it (in Android Studio) on your device, Munin for
Android will be installed alongside with your current version of the app. You'll then be
able to compare both versions, but also keep your settings and servers while testing the
cutting-edge development version!
